	<td colspan="2" bg bgcolor="white" align="center"> <p><br>My involvement here at Millersville has included many things such as being a lacrosse player, doing school clean ups, and being apart of basketball and martial arts club. Since my freshman year I have joined the Millersville mens club Lacrosse team and have improved a lot since first beginning. I have spent a lot of time at Millersville and have just recently done a clean up with the COC club, going around picking up trash around campus.<br><br>I also have been a part of intermural basketball and joined the martial arts club at Millersville. I have coached and played for basketball teams here. I have done muay thai and kickboxing with the martial arts club. I was asked to join the board and teach kickboxing for the martial arts club, but unfortunately, I had to make a decision. I had to choose what I wanted to spend my time at Ville doing, Lacrosse or Kickboxing. I chose to stay with lacrosse and I am glad I did. I have spent most of my free time here at Millersville trying to improve myself for lacrosse. I have spent a lot of time on pucillo field and in the Ville gym trying to get better. I have spent a lot of time at ville lacrosse that I am starter and a strong leader on the team. My time spent at ville has been doing a lot of schoolwork, But when I am not doing academics I am very involved in Lacrosse here at Millersville.</p> </td></tr>
